            <h4>My name is Tyler Miller, I am currently training to become a Junior developer at Epicodus Seattle. I currently attend Seattle Central College with a focus on computer science. when I was 18 I found myself in love with the architectual field, solving problems and building something from scratch became a passion of mine. I was also very into my computer science class early on in college as I found that I had the same passion in a more accesible and pleasing fashion. currently I  enjoy working with DAW's (digital audio workbench) creating music in my spare time. otherwise I enjoy building PC's for friends, family, and myself.</h4>
